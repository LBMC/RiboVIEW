                Kind Request about Changes,
                    in addition to GPL-3

Anyone changing code from this package is kindly asked to do so in a 
minimal and well-commented way. The qualification "minimal" means here 
adding as few as possible new variables, structures or additional 
elements of code. The qualification "well-commented" means here :
(1) including or complementing a header which defines inputs, outputs,
parameters and important variables, 
(2) using clear and unambigous names as far as possible, writing
comments everywhere necessary, so that a reuse of the changed code
stays fairly accessible to others.
