Description: 
  Ribosomes translate messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins, and 
  ribosome profiling technique allows to retrieve those mRNAs fragments which are 
  under active translation in a ribosome. These mRNA fragments are then generally
  sequenced and further analysed for codon enrichment, translation efficiency, etc.
  In this package we provide tools to compute and visualize results, perform 
  quality control, and derive an unbiased estimate of codon enrichment. 
  We offer the user a webpage view to scan own data on the following aspects: 
  periodicity, ligation and digestion of ribosome-protected footprints;
  reproducibility and batch effects of replicates; drugs-related artifacts;
  codon enrichment including variability observed between mRNAs and positions
  for ribosome acceptor, peptidyl and exit (A, P and E, respectively) sites ;
  mining of causal or confounding factors.
