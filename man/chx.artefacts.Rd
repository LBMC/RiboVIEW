\title{Artefacts visible on codon enrichment, due to cycloheximide or other drug}
\usage{
chx.artefacts(XP.conditions, XP.names, pathout, algo="unbiased")
}
\arguments{
\item{XP.conditions}{Vector of experimental conditions for each sample}
\item{XP.names}{Vector of names for each sample}
\item{pathout}{Address where output files will be written}
\item{algo}{Algorithm used, either "unbiased" (default) or "Hussmann"}
}
\value{
This function returns a list containing the following :
\describe{
    \item{plot}{Address of png plot file}
    \item{value}{Standard deviation of enrichment for each codon}
    \item{color}{Color white/orange/red corresponding to good/warning/poor level of quality}
    \item{recommendation}{Description and recommendation based on value}
  }
}
\description{
\code{chx.artefacts} This function takes a list of samples and their conditions as input and 
   visualizes enrichment around AUG +/- 90 codons, where possible artefacts due
   to drugs used in the experiment should be visible.
}
\details{
This function plots enrichment of codons around AUG and 2 further plots dedicated to 
Arginine codons or to Lys-aaa codon.
